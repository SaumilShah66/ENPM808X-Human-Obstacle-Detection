## Overview
Object detection is necessary branch for robotics, especially autonomous robots. In order to navigate a robot in the real world, it is necessary to create a perception of the surrounding in robot’s reference frame. Human detection is a vital problem in the field of object detection. It is absolutely essential for a robot to detect and avoid human obstacles for the safety of people in the working environment of the robot. 
Plethora of work has been done to solve the problem of human detection. Color based approaches don’t perform well for varying lighting conditions. Although deep learning approaches provide state of the art results, but they require too much computational power. We plan to use HOG feature based approach for this module, because it provides good results and is computationally efficient.

We have designed a module, for the ACME Robotics, to detect the positions of humans around the robot. The module works by taking an image and processing it to produce rectangular bounding regions around the detected humans in the environment. The pixel coordinates of the bounding boxes can then be to track the location of human with respect to the robot’s frame of reference. Such a system will help in human obstacle detection and avoidance when the robot is navigation in the real world. 

In order to implement this module, a dataset with set of images containing humans (positive images) and a set not containing humans (negative images) is needed. We plan to use [INRIA Person Dataset](http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/). First, Histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features will be calculated for each of the image. These HOG vectors will then be used as input to train the Support Vector Machine classifier to detect the location of humans in each image. The output of the SVM is compared to the ground truth labels and the error is then fed back to train the classifier. This trained classifier can then be used for real time estimation of human’s position. Training feature will be provided with the module so that it can be improved over time with adding more training data.

We have used openCV 3.3.0 as a third party library, which is covered under the 3-clause BSD License.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation:

HOG features are not scale invariant. Normalising the HOG feature vectors will enable our method to be used in cases of scale variation. 

HOG features are not rotation invariant. Training the SVM on images with humans in different poses and orientation may fix that limitation. 

Since RGB cameras don’t perform in low light conditions it might cause trouble. The module is robust enough to work with infrared cameras in low light conditions.

## Technology Used:

We’ll be using Agile Development Process and quality will be ensured by unit testing, valgrind debugging and cppcheck.
Test Driven Development will be used. It is a software development process that relies on the following sequence: 
Add a test->
Run all tests and see if the new one fails->
Write some code->
Run tests->
Refactor code->
Repeat.

## Known Issues and Bugs
The positive train Images must of the size 96X160 with human being at center of the image. Code will crash for image size less than that.  
We plan to fix this bug in next version.

## Development process

Agile iterative process is being followed for project. The roles were divided into driver, navigator and design keeper, which were shuffled as per tasks. You can find all the logs [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1foEYOV_wYh-uo1HzLIA6oWQsRw7hj1JdQwvthF7eQyE). 
Sprint planning and review notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KDDPczK_SDg7lbxVabgG5e0FX5Kzq_xEpoSlDGbaSM/edit?usp=sharing).

## How to Generate Doxygen Documentation

To install doxygen run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
Now from the cloned directory run:
```
doxygen doxygen
```
